## Description <!-- omit from toc -->
- This is a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file.  
- The purpose is to generate a simple logo for my projects so that I don't have to pay a graphic designer.  
- Node.js with the Inquirer (collecting user input) and Jest (running tests) packages will assist in making the function of this application come to life.  
  - There will be a series of prompts to assist with building your logo.  
  - Once your prompts are finished you will be able to see the SVG image in a browser.

## Installation
  - Go to proper file path and in the command line type <npm â€¦. > to install each package  
    - npx jest = npm i -D jest  
    - Inquirer = npm i inquirer@8.2.4  
    * These packages will be installed after you have entered <node index.js> into the command line  
  - File structure recommended  
    * Added an "output" folder for the newly created svg file to go  
    * Also added was an html folder with a simple boiler plate. It was made to hold img src to output our logo for viewing in the browser

## Features
1. Testing done before I wrote my index.js    
2. Including a wireframe

## Challenges
- My biggest challenge to overcome was writing the testing.  
  1. Figuring out the correct syntax to use in the shapes.test.js  
  2. Learning to understand the errors and how to overcome them, many trial and errors to get the end result
